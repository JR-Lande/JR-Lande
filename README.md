## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joe, JR or Lando. 
I'm currently learning to code with Python which will allow me to work on and build a browser-based game.
While learning, I'd love to collaborate on anything that allows me to learn code faster. 
And I'd love help with learning the basics of Python and also learn some other languages that will help my goal with building the game.
Ask me anything! I'm open to work on or collaborate with anything.
How to reach me: *I'll update my contact information later*

Fun fact: I love pro wrestling, movies and, of course, now I love learning to code.
